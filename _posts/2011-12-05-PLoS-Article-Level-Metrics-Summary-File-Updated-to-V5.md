[PLoS Article Level Metrics][plosalm] data is available through both an [API][almapi] and in a [Summary Excel File][almxls]. The API data is updated more frequently, while the summary file provides a full copy of the data in one download.

The new source file is `plos-alm-v5-09182011.xls` and seems to date from Sep 18, 2011. The [previous version V4][plosalmv4] was `plos-alm-v4-11302010.xls`.
